# Keep Your Software Organized and Up To Date
This document will help me to remember what software I have and what needs to be updated.

### Operating System
Make sure the operating system software is updated.

| Item     | Frequency | How To Update Item           |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Mac OS X | Weekly    | Apple Icon > Software Update |
| Homebrew | Weekly    | Run: brew update             |

### Software Packages Intalled by Homebrew
Every so often check the software that you've installed with homebrew and keep up to date as needed.

- `brew list` to see what was installed using homebrew.
- `brew outdated` to check which packages are out of date.
- `brew upgrade packagename` to upgrade specific packages.
- `brew pin packagename` if you don't want to update specific packages. 
- `brew uninstall packagename` to uninstall software.
