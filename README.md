# My Dev Setup
This is my attempt at documenting my personal development setup on both my local Mac OS X and remote Linux VPS. My aim is to use the local computer for developing JavaScript applications and other coding experiments. The remote Linux server is where I manage my Wordpress blogs. I hope to update this site when I upgrade or add programs or packages to my dev setups. I'll also list technologies that I'm interested in learning or using soon.

I've borrowed from other github repositories for some of this information.

- [System preferences](#system-preferences)
- [Google Chrome](#google-chrome)
- [iTerm2](#iterm2)
- [Atom](#atom)

## System update

Before installing anything, make sure the operating system is updated to the latest version.
- For MAC: **Apple Icon > Software Update...**
- For Linux: Visit the official linux kernal website to determine what the current stable version of the kernal is. (More to come).

## System preferences

These are my personal changes to the System Preferences. (More to come).

## Google Chrome

Install your favorite browser, mine happens to be Chrome.
Download from [www.google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).

## iTerm2

Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) for a better terminal experience.

## Atom

As far as text editors go, I was a hardcore Sublime Text user, until I discovered Atom. There are lots of reasons why I switched to Atom. For starters I love how easy it is to install packages and themes. Sublime was lightning fast and if Atom catches up I don't think I'll be going back to Sublime (but we had a great run)! [Atom](https://atom.io/) is currently my favorite text editor.
